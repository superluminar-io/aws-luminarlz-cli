# Break glass access to the Management account

If administrator access to the management account via SSO breaks,
break glass access can be used to access the `Management` account via IAM user (break glass user).

It is assumed that a shared password manager group is used to store the IAM user's credentials
and to configure MFA with passkeys.

## Requirements

- Administrator access to the `Management` account.
- Access to a shared password manager.

## Set up break glass user

1. Create new entry and password in the password manager.
2. As an additional field add the `Management` account ID.
3. Open the [break glass user in the AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users/details/BreakGlassUser1?section=security_credentials).
4. Set a custom password generated by the password manager.
5. Assign Passkey as an MFA device and store it in the password manager.

## Use the break glass user

1. Use the [sign-in page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?nc2=h_ct&src=header-signin) in a browser window where no SSO session is active.
2. Enter the `Management` account ID and credentials from the password manager and use the Passkey in the MFA dialog.
